## Quick Start

> Before installing ApeRAG, make sure your machine meets the following minimum system requirements:
>
> - CPU >= 2 Core
> - RAM >= 4 GiB
> - Docker & Docker Compose

The easiest way to start ApeRAG is through Docker Compose. Before running the following commands, make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apecloud/ApeRAG.git
cd ApeRAG
cp envs/env.template .env
docker-compose up -d --pull always
```

After running, you can access ApeRAG in your browser at:
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:3000/web/
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

#### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

ApeRAG supports [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) integration, allowing AI assistants to interact with your knowledge base directly. After starting the services, configure your MCP client with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aperag-mcp": {
      "url": "https://rag.apecloud.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `http://localhost:8000` with your actual ApeRAG API URL and `your-api-key-here` with a valid API key from your ApeRAG settings.

The MCP server provides:
- **Collection browsing**: List and explore your knowledge collections
- **Hybrid search**: Search using vector, full-text, and graph methods
- **Intelligent querying**: Ask natural language questions about your documents

#### Enhanced Document Parsing

For enhanced document parsing capabilities, ApeRAG supports an **advanced document parsing service** powered by MinerU, which provides superior parsing for complex documents, tables, and formulas. 

<details>
<summary><strong>Enhanced Document Parsing Commands</strong></summary>

```bash
# Enable advanced document parsing service
DOCRAY_HOST=http://aperag-docray:8639 docker compose --profile docray up -d

# Enable advanced parsing with GPU acceleration 
DOCRAY_HOST=http://aperag-docray-gpu:8639 docker compose --profile docray-gpu up -d
```

Or use the Makefile shortcuts (requires [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)):
```bash
# Enable advanced document parsing service
make compose-up WITH_DOCRAY=1

# Enable advanced parsing with GPU acceleration (recommended)
make compose-up WITH_DOCRAY=1 WITH_GPU=1
```

## Kubernetes Deployment (Recommended for Production)

> **Enterprise-grade deployment with high availability and scalability**

Deploy ApeRAG to Kubernetes using our provided Helm chart. This approach offers high availability, scalability, and production-grade management capabilities.

### Prerequisites

*   [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) (v1.20+)
*   [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) configured and connected to your cluster
*   [Helm v3+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the ApeRAG repository to get the deployment files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apecloud/ApeRAG.git
cd ApeRAG
```

### Step 1: Deploy Database Services

ApeRAG requires PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, and Elasticsearch. You have two options:

**Option A: Use existing databases** - If you already have these databases running in your cluster, edit `deploy/aperag/values.yaml` to configure your database connection details, then skip to Step 2.

**Option B: Deploy databases with KubeBlocks** - Use our automated database deployment (database connections are pre-configured):

```bash
# Navigate to database deployment scripts
cd deploy/databases/

# (Optional) Review configuration - defaults work for most cases
# edit 00-config.sh

# Install KubeBlocks and deploy databases
bash ./01-prepare.sh          # Installs KubeBlocks
bash ./02-install-database.sh # Deploys PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, Elasticsearch

# Monitor database deployment
kubectl get pods -n default

# Return to project root for Step 2
cd ../../
```

Wait for all database pods to be in `Running` status before proceeding.

### Step 2: Deploy ApeRAG Application

```bash
# If you deployed databases with KubeBlocks in Step 1, database connections are pre-configured
# If you're using existing databases, edit deploy/aperag/values.yaml with your connection details

# Deploy ApeRAG
helm install aperag ./deploy/aperag --namespace default --create-namespace

# Monitor ApeRAG deployment
kubectl get pods -n default -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=aperag
```

### Configuration Options

**Resource Requirements**: By default, includes [`doc-ray`](https://github.com/apecloud/doc-ray) service (requires 4+ CPU cores, 8GB+ RAM). To disable: set `docray.enabled: false` in `values.yaml`.

**Advanced Settings**: Review `values.yaml` for additional configuration options including images, resources, and Ingress settings.

### Access Your Deployment

Once deployed, access ApeRAG using port forwarding:

```bash
# Forward ports for quick access
kubectl port-forward svc/aperag-frontend 3000:3000 -n default
kubectl port-forward svc/aperag-api 8000:8000 -n default

# Access in browser
# Web Interface: http://localhost:3000
# API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

For production environments, configure Ingress in `values.yaml` for external access.

### Troubleshooting

**Database Issues**: See `deploy/databases/README.md` for KubeBlocks management, credentials, and uninstall procedures.

**Pod Status**: Check pod logs for any deployment issues:
```bash
kubectl logs -f deployment/aperag-api -n default
kubectl logs -f deployment/aperag-frontend -n default
```
